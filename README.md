## Setting up the environment

1. To get started, ensure that you have the correct version of python installed. This repository is currently using version `3.10.0`.

2. Create a python virtual environment for the backend. WARNING: Ensure that the environment is called `venv` exactly. Otherwise, the `.gitignore` will not detect it and, the files will be pushed to the repository.

```zsh
cd backend;
python3 -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the environment.

```zsh
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install necessary modules and dependencies.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
