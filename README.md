<h1 align="center"> Frontend of QuantSoc Website</h1>

<!-- deployment badge here -->

This repo contains the source code for the frontend of the main website of the ðŸ“ˆUNSW Quantitative Finance and Trading Society (Quantsoc), powered by [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/).

<!-- ## Major packages (add this later perhaps) --> 

## Quick start
Once you have  a rather recent version of `npm` installed on a (preferably) Unix based system, simply run: 
```
$ npm install
$ npm run prepare
```
Then you may run a development setting via:
```
$ npm run start
```

## Tests and linting
The cleansing process will run before each push, however, you can run the linting and test manually by doing: 
```
$ npm run lint
$ npm run test
```

## Running in production
To run a quick production build, simply do:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run serve
```
